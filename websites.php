	<h2>Website Development</h2>

	<p>If you don't have an official website, what are people finding when they search for you? By having your own Pharmacy website, you will have a direct online reference for your customers with information you want presented and know is accurate.</p>

	<p>Our website development offering is simple. We start with a basic template, ask you for the information and pictures we need, fill it in and get it online. You don't need to know anything about how websites work to get started. Check out the link at the bottom of the page for an example of what your site could look like.</p>

	<p>If we develop your website for you, we will also maintain it for as long as you're a member of Pharm AssessRBS. You can request content changes and updates and we will make sure the website is always online and available to your customers to find.</p>

	<h2>Website Maintenance</h2>

	<p>If you already have a website, we can still assist you with maintenance. If you already had a website online before joining Pharm AssessRBS that you're happy with, but need help with posting new content or updating content, we can help with that too. We would simply need your site url and login information to get started.</p>
